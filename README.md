Client-Server architecture for two player battleship game

## Features
- Multiplayer

## Build && Run
I have added two **build.xml** files for client and server.
Go to the corresponding directories and just type command ```$ ant``` on the terminal and run the **build.xml** files.
They will be built automatically and run :+1: :white_check_mark:
